# Machine-Predictive-Maintenance-Classification

1. Conducted data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering on a synthetic dataset with key variables such as temperature, speed, and torque to enhance model readiness and prevent data leakage.
2. Developed and compared multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest) to accurately predict machine failures, achieving model accuracy scores of 97.75%, 97.4%, and 98.15%, respectively.
3. Random Forest provides the highest accuracy (98.15%) to support effective predictive maintenance and reduce machine downtime.
